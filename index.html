[Intro: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I feel like I'm here with Jason
I feel like I made it
    </pre>
    <pre>
[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I like those chicks cause problems
It make me feel better than ever
I chose that Rolls over 'Rari
Got in it, feel better than ever
I know she wish she didn't cross me
I been doin' better than ever
I take these drugs while exhausted
Have me feelin' better than ever

[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I accepted everything that they said 'bout me, let 'em keep talkin', only make me do better
Go harder, I'm special
I'm a thugged-out nigga, my feelings dropped in the letter
I do my shit on all these bitches, I won't let up
And God chose me
So tell that bitch stop hatin' on me
So tell that bitch, so tell that broad I hustle hard for everything
Nigga gon' lose they life, I don't know one thing, they think they scarin' me
Came up picturin' paintin'
I can't picture pain, them feelings runnin' through lil' shorty
She say you did her wrong, I say it's all me
I say, "Leave shit alone, girl, focus on ballin'"
One day, he'll see you losing, you'll see him back calling
Grab the a phone, call up my dog, I don't know about all this
I don't know what we beefin' for
Rolls-Royce and we both in it, should be
Gave this ho my last name, wish she would cheat
Think of everything I achieved and feel relieved
Look at me, designer my clothes (Woah-oh)
I get camo'd down, got several hoes, got several homes
They left me stranded and they left me down
See 'em blessing and I'm winning, I barely pick up my phone
And they can't call now
See upcoming rap shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I like those chicks cause problems
It make me feel better than ever
I chose that Rolls over 'Rari
Got in it, feel better than ever
I know she wish she didn't cross me
I been doin' better than ever
I take these drugs while exhausted
Have me feelin' better than ever

[Verse 2: Rod Wave]
You on my mind right now
I'ma fly from out of town
I can't put this cup down
Them pills gon' make me smile
I was wonderin' what happened, how'd your love get out of bounds?
I ignored you when you called, read your message, laughed out loud
I'm doin' way better now, fell in love with my hustle
On the road doin' shows, it's just me and all my brothers
We ain't got the same parents, but we had the same struggle
'Member back when we was broke, all we had was each other
And now I'm Maybach ridin', look how far a nigga came
I was on the block without a thing
I was tryna hustle up a zip, I was tryna rap, tryna sing
If I could take it all back again, there's so much the shit that I'd change
Hopin' I don't die over fame, cousin Brock died over 'caine
Nigga pillow talkin' to a bitch, hope he die tryna say my name
And, they say happiness, one day I'll find
One day, it'll be alright
Look at me
Tell me, what do you see when you look at me?
I'm finally free


[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
I like those chicks cause problems
It make me feel better than ever
I chose that Rolls over 'Rari
Got in it, feel better than ever
I know she wish she didn't cross me
I been doin' better than ever
I take these drugs while exhausted
Have me feelin' better than ever
